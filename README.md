# MacOS-Virus
This will open a bunch of macOS apps, then send a thousand notifications, and take hundreds of screenshots. It will slow down any mac computer it touches. 

To open, press Ctrl+Click on the app, then press open, and on the warning press open anyway or whatever it says.

Or, if its kept a script, open in AppleScript and press the run button at the top
